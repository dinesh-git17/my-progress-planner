# Sweethearty Update – Fresh Look, Smarter Notifications & Smoother Navigation

> Your favourite meal‑tracker just got a major makeover! We’ve overhauled the interface, improved loading times and added a brand‑new update system to keep you in the loop without interrupting your flow.

## Features

- Smart update notifications: A new in‑app notification shows release notes from a markdown file. It’s scrollable, beautifully styled and won’t unexpectedly reload your app.
- Unified celebration & completion modals: Whether you finish logging a meal or complete a chat, you’ll see a consistent glass‑morphism modal with smooth animations and clear calls‑to‑action.
- MealChat glow‑up: Enjoy a sleek new chat interface with dynamic tab titles, pretty gradient message bubbles and an adorable animated heart icon
- Faster, smoother navigation: Loading screens now appear across all pages with vibrant gradients and skeletons; page transitions feel native on iOS and the keyboard stays put
- Modern login & welcome screens: Sign‑in and welcome pages now sport a full‑screen design with bold colours, streamlined buttons and no more unnecessary loading screens
- Easier PWA installation: A revamped install prompt with platform icons makes adding Sweethearty to your home screen simple
- Offline‑friendly & mock GPT support: Data is preserved during updates, and developers get a built‑in mock GPT environment for offline testing
- Rebranded & polished: The app is now called Sweethearty
